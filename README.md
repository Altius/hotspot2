hotspot2 v1.1 is a program developed at the Altius Institute for Biomedical Sciences in Seattle, U.S.A.
for identifying genomic regions with statistically significant "hotspots," or enrichments,
of cleavage activity in DNase-seq experiments.  It is designed to run in a UNIX environment,
and to work with alignment files in BAM format.

hotspot2 requires each of the following programs to be installed and accessible from the user's path
before it can be used:
* g++ (or an equivalent C++ compiler; replace "g++" with its name in Makefile in this case)
* bedops
* samtools
* bedGraphToBigWig
* modwt

hotspot2 tallies cleavages within a small region ("window") around each site.  It slides the window
across the genome, and statistically evaluates cleavage tallies within their local context, i.e.,
within a larger "background window" that itself slides across the genome.  To enable hotspot2
to distinguish between "no data" (e.g., an unmappable region or the end of a chromosome) and
"no cleavages" (a valid region in which no cleavages were observed in the DNase-seq experiment),
a file of chromosome sizes is required.  Ideally, a file containing all the mappable regions
in the genome (e.g., regions uniquely mappable by 36mers) should also be supplied by the user.
(If a "blacklist" of, e.g., mappable but problematic microsatellite regions is available
for the genome, it should be subtracted from the file of mappable regions before being supplied
to hotspot2.)

Note:  In the file of chromosome sizes, the "start" of each chromosome (column 2) must be 0.

Before hotspots can be identified, the set of viable positions that can serve as centers of
sliding windows must be determined.  The script `extractCenterSites.sh` in the scripts subdirectory
must be run to determine these positions.  This script requires a file of chromosome sizes
and the name of the file to which the positions should be written.  A file of mappable regions
can optionally be provided as well, and this is highly recommended.  The default radius around
each position is 100 bp, yielding a sliding window of width 201 bp; a different value can be
supplied if desired.  To see the usage information for this script, type

    scripts/extractCenterSites.sh -h

Note:  `extractCenterSites.sh` only needs to be run once per genome.  (If analyses with different
window sizes are desired, `extractCenterSites.sh` needs to be run once per window size per genome.)

Hotspots are called for an input alignment file in BAM format via a set of scripts that are
each executed by the `hotspot2.sh` script.  This script also executes a program that needs to
be compiled or "made" on the computer where hotspot2.sh will run.  To make the hotspot2 program,
simply type the command `make` from within the hotspot2 directory.  (This will create the program
hotspot2 in the subdirectory bin.)

Note:  After the program hotspot2 is made, it must be added to the user's PATH.

Once the hotspot2 program has been compiled and the center sites file has been created
by running `extractCenterSites.sh`, `hotspot2.sh` will be ready to run.  To see the usage information
for this script, including descriptions of its various parameters and their default settings, type

    scripts/hotspot2.sh -h

To run hotspot2.sh with default values for its various parameters, type

    scripts/hotspot2.sh yourData.bam yourOutputDirectory

(`hotspot2.sh` will create the output directory `yourOutputDirectory` if it does not already exist.)
In this example, after `hotspot2.sh` completes its tasks, the following files will be located
in `yourOutputDirectory`:

* yourData.allcalls.starch
* yourData.cleavage.total
* yourData.cutcounts.starch
* yourData.density.bw
* yourData.density.starch
* yourData.fragments.sorted.starch
* yourData.hotspots.fdr0.05.starch
* yourData.peaks.narrowpeaks.starch
* yourData.peaks.starch
* yourData.SPOT.txt

In a typical use case, only two of these files might be of interest, `yourData.hotspots.fdr0.05.starch`
and `yourData.SPOT.txt`.  The former contains the hotspots called at the specified (in this case, default)
FDR threshold.  The latter contains the SPOT score, or Signal Portion Of Tags; it is a metric that
gives an indication of the quality of the sample and/or of the experiment.  The SPOT score is simply
the number of (mappable) cleavages observed in hotspots divided by the total number of (mappable) cleavages;
it therefore can range from 0 to 1.

After hotspots have been called at the specified threshold, the user might be interested in examining
hotspot calls at a different FDR threshold.  This can be done without re-running the entire hotspot2
pipeline, using the `yourData.allcalls.starch` file and the `hsmerge.sh` script.  In this example, to call
hotspots at FDR threshold 0.01, type

    scripts/hsmerge.sh -f 0.01 yourOutputDirectory/yourData.allcalls.starch yourOutputDirectory/yourData.hotspots.fdr0.01.starch

Note:  The `SITECALL_THRESHOLD` (`-F`) that was supplied to hotspot2.sh will be the upper limit at which
hotspots can be re-called using `hsmerge.sh`.  If it was set to, e.g., 0.05 for the sake of speed and
the size of the `yourData.allcalls.starch` file, and hotspots called at threshold 0.10 are then desired,
`hotspot2.sh` would need to be re-run with `-f 0.10` and `-F 0.10` (or a higher threshold for the latter).

hotspot2 was developed by Eric Rynes, Jeff Vierstra, Jemma Nelson, Richard Sandstrom, Shane Neph,
and Audra Johnson.
